sonar-hla
=========

High Level API for accessing SonarQube resources.

Intention of this project is to hide the complexity of of Sonar's Web Service Client
and provide instead an easy to use API for accessing most important data from a 
SonarQube server.

This program is young! It started in August 2014. So don't expect too much right now!
There are no tags so far and no artifacts in any public Maven repository. But just
stay tuned. Hopefully a first tagged version with some basic functionality will come soon.
