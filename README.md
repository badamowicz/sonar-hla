sonar-hla
=========

High Level API for accessing SonarQube resources.

Intention of this project is to hide the complexity of of Sonar's Web Service Client
and provide instead an easy to use API for accessing most important data from a 
SonarQube server.

This program is young! It started in August 2014. So don't expect too much right now!
However, one release has already been created (0.3.1) which is also available in
Maven Central. Have a look at the Wiki dokumentation to get the details.
