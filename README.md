sonar-hla
=========

High Level API for accessing SonarQube resources.

Intention of this project is to hide the complexity of Sonar's Web Service Client
and provide instead an easy to use API for accessing most important data from a 
SonarQube server.

This program is young! It started in August 2014. So don't expect too much right now!
However, some releases have already been created which are also available in
Maven Central. And some usefull features are already available.

Have a look at the Wiki dokumentation to get the details.

=======================

* Write generated CSV data to file.
